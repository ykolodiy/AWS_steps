To expose MySQL to anything other than localhost you will have to have the following line

For mysql version 5.6 and below

uncommented in /etc/mysql/my.cnf and assigned to your computers IP address and not loopback

For mysql version 5.7 and above

uncommented in /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf and assigned to your computers IP address and not loopback

#Replace xxx with your IP Address 
bind-address        = xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
Or add a  bind-address       = 0.0.0.0 if you don't want to specify the IP

Then stop and restart MySQL with the new my.cnf entry. Once running go to the terminal and enter the following command.

lsof -i -P | grep :3306
That should come back something like this with your actual IP in the xxx's

mysqld  1046  mysql  10u  IPv4  5203  0t0  TCP  xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:3306 (LISTEN)
If the above statement returns correctly you will then be able to accept remote users. However for a remote user to connect with the correct priveleges you need to have that user created in both the localhost and '%' as in.

CREATE USER 'myuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'mypass';
CREATE USER 'myuser'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'mypass';
then,

GRANT ALL ON *.* TO 'myuser'@'localhost';
GRANT ALL ON *.* TO 'myuser'@'%';
and finally,

FLUSH PRIVILEGES; 
EXIT;
