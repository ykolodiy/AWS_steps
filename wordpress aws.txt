Map IP Address and Domain Name

To use your blog in production, you will have to:

Associate an IP address to your instance
Map your domain name to that IP address
To associate an IP address to your instance:

In the AWS Management Console, click Elastic IPs (left navigation bar)
Click Allocate New Address, and confirm by clicking the “Yes, Allocate” button
Right-click the newly allocated IP address and select “Associate” in the popup menu. Select the instance you just created and click “Yes, Associate”
To map your domain name to your IP address, you will have to use the tools provided by your domain registrar. If you use GoDaddy, specify NS73.DOMAINCONTROL.COM and NS74.DOMAINCONTROL.COM as the name servers for your domain, and use the DNS Manager to modify the A record and point to your IP address. Documentation is available here.

Once everything is configured and mapped correctly, access the General Settings in the WordPress management console and make sure the WordPress Address and Site Address are specified correctly using your domain name as in the screenshot below.
