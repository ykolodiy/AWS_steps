Map IP Address and Domain Name

To use your blog in production, you will have to:

Associate an IP address to your instance
Map your domain name to that IP address
To associate an IP address to your instance:

In the AWS Management Console, click Elastic IPs (left navigation bar)
Click Allocate New Address, and confirm by clicking the “Yes, Allocate” button
Right-click the newly allocated IP address and select “Associate” in the popup menu. Select the instance you just created and click “Yes, Associate”
To map your domain name to your IP address, you will have to use the tools provided by your domain registrar. If you use GoDaddy, specify NS73.DOMAINCONTROL.COM and NS74.DOMAINCONTROL.COM as the name servers for your domain, and use the DNS Manager to modify the A record and point to your IP address. Documentation is available here.

Once everything is configured and mapped correctly, access the General Settings in the WordPress management console and make sure the WordPress Address and Site Address are specified correctly using your domain name as in the screenshot below.

links not working?
try to change permalinks from text to numbers

In /etc/apache2/apache2.conf, edit AllowOverride None for /var/www/ to AllowOverride All
Type in the following command to enable mod_rewrite for .htaccess
sudo a2enmod rewrite

Restart your apache server:
sudo service apache2 restart

The problem solved!!!


Try flushing your mod_rewrite rules:

Dashboard -> Settings -> Permalinks

Save settings (no need to make any changes)



if you map your url to some like 000webhost in wordpress to make wp-login working add to wpconfig
define('ADMIN_COOKIE_PATH', '/'); define('COOKIE_DOMAIN', ''); define('COOKIEPATH', ''); define('SITECOOKIEPATH', '');


when you park domain it can prevent css fonts to show
just add to .htaccess 
<FilesMatch "\.(ttf|ttc|otf|eot|woff)$">
    <IfModule mod_headers.c>
        Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
    </IfModule>
</FilesMatch>"
